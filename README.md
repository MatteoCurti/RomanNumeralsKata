- Verify the correct conversion of all limit cases (for example, 1999) according to the standard described in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals.

- Check if the following property can be used: divide the Arabic number into digits (1903 = 1 * 1000, 9 * 100, 0 * 10, 3 * 1) and convert each single Roman numeral into Roman numerals and concatenate the result. Therefore 1000 = M, 900 = CM, 3 = III, results MCMII.
